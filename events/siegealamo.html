		<h1>The Siege of The Alamo</h1>
		<p class="thing">After losing San Antonio to the Texans, the Mexican General, Santa Anna was determined to reclaim the key location that they lost. With these goals, Santa Annaâ€™s army arrived in San Antonio on February 23, 1836. 145 Texans in the area took refuge on fortified grounds. Then, over the following two weeks, The Mexican army was strengthened to over 2000 troops. At the same time, the Texan army had reinforcements too. The siege ended on March 6, when Mexicans stormed the Alamo fortress, and all of the Texan defenders died.
