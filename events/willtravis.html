		<h1>William Travis's Letter</h1>
		<p class="thing">William Travis’s Letter was written on February 24, 1836. The letter signed “Victory or Death”,  has come to be known as “The Travis Letter.” At the Alamo in San Antonio, which used to be San Antonio De Valero, 150 rebels led by William Barret Travis stood against Santa Anna’s army, but Santa Anna’s troops broke though the doors on March 6, and all of the defenders died. This letter was brought from the Alamo by Captain Albert Martin of Gonzales. On March 2, a lot of copies were made. The original letter returned with the Travis family shortly after the Revolution. The William Travis Letter is now in the Texas State Library and can be seen there. It holds a strong part in Texas history.
