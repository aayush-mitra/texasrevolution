		<h1>The Battle of San Jacinto</h1>
		<p class="thing">On April 21, 1836, the Battle of San Jacinto took place. Sam Houston and 800 Texans defeated Santa Anna’s Mexican forces, and there were about 1,500 mexican men at the battle. They shouted phrases such as, “Remember the Alamo” as they attacked. Victory was achieved by the Texans. In May, Santa Anna, who was a prisoner during the battle, signed a peace treaty in which Texas was declared a republic.
