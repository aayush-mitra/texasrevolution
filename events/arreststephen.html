		<h1>The Arrest of Stephen Austin</h1>
		<p class="thing">Stephen F. Austin was arrested in January, 1834 by the Mexican government, and had been taken to Mexico City to been imprisoned. When Austin was finally released, eight months later in August 1835, Austin found that the Anglo American colonists were on the edge of revolution, and they were demanding Texas to become a republic, that would isolate itself entirely from the Mexican nation. Austin lost his hope that the Anglo Texans could remain part of Mexico, so he decided to prepare for war. The following year, Austin helped the Texans fight to achieve victory over the Mexicans, and then helped in the creation of the Republic of Texas.
