		<p class="thing">The Fredonian Rebellion started on December 21, 1826. The Fredonian Rebellion was a disagreement among the Mexican government and the Haden Edwards. In April 1825, Haden Edwards settled 800 families in the area around Nacogdoches. In mid-year of 1826, his contract was declared forfeit because he was upsetting settlers, and Edwards was shocked. He forms his own republic of "Fredonia". The Mexican government decided to send troops, and they flee.</p>
